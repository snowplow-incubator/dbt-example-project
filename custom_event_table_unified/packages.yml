packages:
  - package: snowplow/snowplow_unified 
    version: [">=0.5.0", "<0.6.0"]

# Never overwrite the snowplow_unified package directly, this should just be referenced here
# To make changes to the default package behavior, you can disable specific models, seed files that you want to overwrite
# You can also override dispatch type macros (https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/dispatch)
# To do this, add a macro with the same name as in the unified package that you can customize and dbt will use that instead
