    version: [">=0.5.0", "<0.6.0"]

# Never overwrite the snowplow_unified package directly, this should just be a reference here
# then either disable specific models, seed files that you want to overwrite or if it is a macro customization
# if it is a dispatch type macro, you can just add a macro with the same name as in the unified package 
# and dbt will use that instead, for custom logic
